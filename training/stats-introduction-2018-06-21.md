## Overview
This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis. Practicals are conducted using the ‘Shiny’ package; which provides an accessible interface to the R statistical language.

Note that this is not a course for learning about the R statistical language itself. If you wish to learn more about R, please see other courses at the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core.

## Who should attend this course?


## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
- Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
